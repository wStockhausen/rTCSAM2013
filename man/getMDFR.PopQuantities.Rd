\description{
Function to get predicted population quantities (time series) from 
several model runs.
}
\details{
Potential values for 'type' are:
\itemize{
 \item {'MB_yx' - mature biomass at spawning time (1000's t)}
 \item {'R_y' - recruitment (millions)}
 \item {'iN_xmsz' - initial (July 1) abundance by x,m,s,z (millions)}
 \item {'fN_xmsz' - final (July 1) abundance by x,m,s,z (millions)}
 \item {'N_yxmsz' - annual (July 1) abundance by x,m,s,z (millions)}
 \item {'N_yxmz'  - annual (July 1) abundance by x,m,z (millions)}
 \item {'N_yxz'   - annual (July 1) abundance by x,z (millions)}
 \item {'N_yxms'  - annual (July 1) abundance by x,m,s (millions)}
 \item {'N_yxm'   - annual (July 1) abundance by x,m (millions)}
 \item {'N_yx'    - annual (July 1) abundance by x (millions)}
}
